# ETL-pipeline-using-Apache-Airflow

## Project Description
### Introduction
In an effort to alleviate traffic congestion on national highways, this project is dedicated to analyzing road traffic data collected from various toll plazas across the country. Each national highway is operated by different toll operators, each with their unique IT setups and data file formats. The primary goal of this project is to collect traffic data, which is available in diverse formats, and consolidate it into a unified and structured data repository.

### Project Overview
Traffic congestion is a persistent problem on national highways, leading to inefficiencies, increased travel times, and environmental concerns. A key challenge in addressing this issue is the disparate data sources and formats used by various toll operators. To tackle this problem, we have developed a data pipeline leveraging Apache Airflow, an open-source platform that allows us to automate, schedule, and monitor data workflows.

### Key Objectives
Data Collection: Our project involves the collection of traffic data from different toll plazas, including information such as vehicle_id, vehicle_type, and toll_plaza_id, as vehicles pass through the toll booths.

Data Standardization: We will employ data standardization and transformation processes to convert the diverse data formats from different toll operators into a common format.

Data Integration: Apache Airflow will play a crucial role in orchestrating data integration, ensuring that the consolidated data is stored in a single, structured repository.

Data Analysis: Once the data is consolidated, we will perform advanced analytics and generate insights to support decongestion strategies.

### Technologies Used
Apache Airflow: The project's backbone for workflow automation and data orchestration.
Python: Utilized for data transformation, analysis, and integration.
SQL: To structure and query the consolidated data.
GitHub: To host the project code, workflows, and documentation.
